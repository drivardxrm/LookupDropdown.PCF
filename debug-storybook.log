[15:54:28.802] [ERROR] Blockers detected

Storybook has found potential blockers that need to be resolved before upgrading:

HTML Webpack5 support removed

Please migrate your Webpack5-based frameworks to their Vite equivalents.

Affected projects: C:/Source_Github/LookupDropdown.PCF/.storybook

More information: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#dropped-webpack5-builder-support-in-favor-of-vite

---

After addressing this, you can try running the upgrade command again. You can also rerun the upgrade command with the --force flag to skip the blocker check and to proceed with the upgrade.
